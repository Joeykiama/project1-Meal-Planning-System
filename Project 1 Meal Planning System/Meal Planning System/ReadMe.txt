1.Save the .java files, such as User.java, Dietitian.java, Customer.java, Meal.java, MessageBroker.java, and Database.java. Then, compile each file using the javac command in your terminal or command prompt.
     Copy code
  javac User.java Dietitian.java Customer.java Meal.java MessageBroker.java Database.java
2. Run the Program: After successful compilation, run the main program (which might be Main.java or any other class you designate as the entry point) using the java command followed by the class name.

    Copy code
    java Main
3. Interact with the Program: You can interact with the program by creating instances of Dietitians, Customers, and Meals, publishing meals, subscribing to meal plans, and unsubscribing as desired. The Message Broker will handle notifications accordingly.
This setup provides a basic framework for the modules and interactions described in the scenario.
